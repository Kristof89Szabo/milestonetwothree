4 values:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools: Agile prioritizes the importance of effective communication and
collaboration between team members over relying solely on rigid processes or tools.


- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation: Agile emphasizes the delivery of functional software as the primary
measure of progress, rather than extensive documentation that may not reflect the true state of the project.


- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation: Agile promotes close collaboration with customers and stakeholders
throughout the development process, valuing their feedback and involvement to ensure the end product meets their needs.

- **Responding to change** over following a plan: Agile recognizes that requirements and circumstances can change over the
course of a project. It emphasizes the ability to adapt and respond to change quickly and effectively.
