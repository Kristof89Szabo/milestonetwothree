### Generics

Generics in Java allow for creating classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different types of data. There
are several reasons why you should use and create generics in your Java code:

- <u>Type Safety</u>: Generics provide compile-time type checking which helps to prevent runtime errors due to type mismatches.
By specifying the type parameter, you can ensure that only the compatible data types are used with the generic code.


- <u>Code Reusability</u>: Generics allow you to write code that can work with a wide range of data types. This can help to
reduce code duplication and improve code readability.


- <u>Flexibility</u>: Generics can work with any data type, including custom classes, which provides more flexibility than using
specific data types.


- <u>Performance</u>: Generics allow the Java compiler to optimize code by eliminating unnecessary type casting and object
creation at runtime.


- <u>API Design</u>: Generics can be used to design APIs that are more intuitive and easier to use. They can help to reduce the
complexity of method signatures and improve the readability of code.


Overall, using and creating generics in Java can improve the safety, efficiency, and flexibility of your code, making it
easier to read and maintain over time.
